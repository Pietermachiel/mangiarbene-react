# Jekyll/React API endpoint demo

## React version

With Jekyll it is very well possible to create API endpoints, so blog and collections can be consumed in other website generators. 

This **React** website [Mangiarbene](https://api.roozen.nl) is equivalent to the **Jekyll** website [MangiarBene](https://trim-seahorse.cloudvent.net/). The React version consumes the data of the Jekyll version through the provided API endpoints.
